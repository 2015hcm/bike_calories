# bike_calories --This is a JHU-DPP class week 4 project.

This App takes user input from bike ride stats and returns calories expended.

The Shiny application accepts user input for bike distance in km, elevation gain in m, and body and bike weight in kg.

The App then returns a calorie count based on a 3-variable model trained by linear regression on actual activity data recorded.

The App has a second Tab for displaying the parameters from the model, and a 3D scatter plot of partial data used in the model.
